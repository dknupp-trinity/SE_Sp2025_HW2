            Welcome to my food website thing!<br> I'm David, and becoming a chef was actually my first ever dream job when I was a kid.

            <p style="padding-top: 70px;"> From a very young age - maybe five or six years old - I dreamed of becoming a chef. had food-themed Play-Doh sets, Easy-Bake and Queasy-Bake ovens, and I sometimes placed my cats inside their cylindrical cat-house with a bunch of their toys, rolled it around, and pretended I was making cat soup (no cats were harmed in the making of the soup).</p>
            
            <p>I never did a lot of real cooking as a kid; somehow my fascination with cooking did not seem to overcome whatever personal (or parental) obstacles that may have been coming between me and a knife and stove. Eventually, I grew out of the passion, but I did take a cooking intersession in high school. The only thing I can remember making was a loaf of orange-zest bread (and having a very difficult time with the orange zest). But for the purposes of this website, I am an elite super-chef.</p>
            
            <p>My favorite recipes usually include pastas and pastries, but I also enjoy simple meat dishes - I have a low tolerance for spices.</p>
